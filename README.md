Technologys used:
1.)React JS
2.)Node JS

React JS was used to consume from a Django Rest API. Since React is a popular Javascript Framework I utilized it to consume from my Python Django Rest Backend.
To allow for the two Technologys to work together I used a Popular Package on the backend side called Django Cors Headers to allow both Servers to be able to communicate.
If you are Interested in looking at the Backend Side take a look at my other Repository that contains the Django Rest Framework backend called (restrauntreviewapi).


#Here is a Look at the React Side Landing Page. Here we can see Data being pulled from the Django Rest API and being Displayed. It gives us all Restraunt Reviews by a User.
